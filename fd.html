            <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01054464.pdf" target="_blank">Retting et al.</a> suggests that in dispute processes such as in divorce proceedings, individuals are primarily concerned with fair procedures and <strong>procedural justice</strong>. Elements of procedural justice include exhibiting respect, voice, understanding, neutral decision-making, and helpfulness.</p>

            <a href="https://www.courtinnovation.org/sites/default/files/documents/P_J_Evaluation.pdf" target="_blank"><p class="case-quote">Procedural justice research has shown that when defendants and litigants perceive the court process to be fair, they are more likely to comply with court orders and to follow the law in the future, regardless of whether they “win” or “lose” their case.</p></a>

            <p class="">As such, procedural justice was a concept that we constantly used when empathizing with users.</p>
            <p class="">Needing a better understanding of the current divorce process, we collaborated with a local divorce firm and simplified their divorce process into six steps:</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.separation.ca/help-centre/separation/importance-of-financial-disclosure/" target="_blank">financial disclosure</a> (second step) is a holistic snapshot of a client's financial situation including assets, liabilities, expenses, etc. It typically involves the help of CDFAs, lawyers, and mediators. This step allows legal procedings to divide financial components evenly among spouses in a divorce. Our research with the firm suggested that financial disclosure is the most painful step.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Competitive Heatmap Analysis</p>
            <p class="">To understand the legal-tech climate as it pertained to dispute resolution, we analysed eight other competitive solutions.</p>
            <p class="">We asked several legal professionals from our industry partner to rate each product on various features to formulate a heatmap (darker shades represent higher values).</p>

            <p class="">There seemed to be a lack of affordable solutions that addressed financial disclosure document generation, professional collaboration, and client experience management.</p>

          <p class="case-section-desc">Now that we specified potential solutions and goals, we quickly developed prototypes to visualize and quantify the experience we were proposing. This also allowed us to explore the information architecture and the sequential process of each task in greater detail.</p>

            <p>We each brainstormed features that could be used to achieve our user-centered goals, then converged our findings to remove redundancy. Using these features, we diverged and converged once more to ideate on potential screens and process flows.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Lean Evaluation</p>
            <p>We conducted <i>Wizard of Oz</i> usability testing with a paper prototype to quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of the initial iteration. We also asked our participants to engage in a think-aloud protocol as they went through the main function of the application (creating a group and scheduling a meeting).</p>

            <p><strong>What Went Well</strong><br>
            Our participants seemed to like how easy it was to set up a group, the aggregation of every member's calendar into a single group calendar, and the ability to confirm a meeting time which was similar to RSVPing to an event.</p>

            <p><strong>What Could be Improved</strong><br>
            Moving forward, we needed to address user's concerns about keeping their own day-to-day activities private, the redundancy of a voting system given the final confirmation, integrating non-University events, and the clarity of particular labels.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Mid Fidelity Prototype</p>
            <p>Using the feedback from our users, we developed a mid-fidelity prototype in Figma.</p>

          <h3 class="case-section-title">Verifying the Efficacy</h3>
          <p class="case-section-desc">Before the next design iteration, it's imperative that we conduct summative research to examine our progress and the effectiveness of our mid-fidelity solution. We used the <a href="http://www.id-book.com/fourthedition/downloads/ID3Chapter13Anevaluationframework.pdf" target="_blank">DECIDE framework</a> to validate any of our previous assumptions and examine the efficacy of the MVP.</p>
          <div class="py-3"></div>

        <div class="row">

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Heuristic Analysis</p>
            <p class="">After interacting with the prototype, we asked the participants to rate their overall satisfaction with each task out of five.</p>

            <p class="">Users found that syncing their personal calendar with Avail was relatively unambiguous but suggested improvements to the clarity of the icons. When asked, they were unsure whether the calendar would automatically sync with the system or if it needed to be synced by the user every time. Moving forward, we need to clarify this point in order to achieve our first hill.</p>

            </a>

            <p class="">Finally, users were asked if they would need to resort back to negotiating meeting times after using Avail. All four users mentioned that they would only need to do so in very rare circumstances. In this sense, we were able to achieve our second hill.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Focus Group Study</p>
            <p class="">Since we timed the user's completion of the three tasks separately, we were able to assess the usability of the MVP as well as whether it fulfilled our final hill of finalizing a meetup schedule in less than 10 minutes.</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-between">
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center text-muted ">
                <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">27s</h1>
                <p>Task 1</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center text-muted ">
                <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">34s</h1>
                <p>Task 2</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center text-muted ">
                <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">1m 46s</h1>
                <p>Task 3</p>
              </div>            
            </div>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="">Since our prototype was designed to follow a happy path, we don't anticipate that these times would reflect real-world interactions perfectly. However, even if we were to double, triple, or even quadruple these times, our third hill is still met and the time needed to finalize a meeting was significantly less than 10 minutes.</p>

            <p class="">We also asked the participant to complete the <a href="https://measuringu.com/sus/" target="_blank">System Usability Scale</a>, a peer-reviewed and standardized measurement of usability where a score of <strong>68</strong> is considered average. Our mean SUS score was <strong>79.38</strong>. We believe our score was relatively high given the simplicity of our application; we anticipate this score to decrease as we introduce more features in future iterations but are optimistic of the current results.</p>

      <div class="case-reflection">
        <h3 class="case-reflection-title">Reflection</h3>
        <p class="">Overall, this two-month long project was based on the assumption that scheduling group meetings was a difficult and inefficient task. We were able to verify this idea using research and ultimately, we were also able to address this problem through the ideation of a potential solution. Along the way, I learned three key things that will extend to my future work:</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Interpret Data with Caution</p>
        <p class="">Don't follow what users say blindly, but rather interpret their suggestions appropriately to focus on what users actually want and what users actually need (e.g. privacy, simplicity).</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Avoid Working in a Silo</p>
        <p class="">As was also suggested in our secondary research, our best work was done when everyone was present in person and communicating effectively. Like Sam, we had to deal with scheduling logistics as well, but that didn't stop us!</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Keep an Open Mind</p>
        <p class="">Facing criticism and unexpected research findings give way for growth and will lead to the design and development of a great solution. Recognize  biases (confirmation bias, observer biases, response biases) to avoid them.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with this solution, we would like to extend our mid-fi assessment to develop a higher-fidelity prototype with additional features to test beyond the happy path, such as incorporating locations, direct interaction with the main calendar, and exporting data to other applications (such as Facebook Messenger). We would also like to extend our findings to larger sample sizes and populations outside of the University of Toronto in order to pitch this solution to scale.</p>
