Since we focused on dispute resolution, we looked into the legal separation process in Ontario. These were the key insights in our user discovery process.</p>

            <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01054464.pdf" target="_blank">Retting et al.</a> suggests that in dispute processes such as in divorce proceedings, individuals are primarily concerned with fair procedures and <strong>procedural justice</strong>. Elements of procedural justice include exhibiting respect, voice, understanding, neutral decision-making, and helpfulness.</p>

            <a href="https://www.courtinnovation.org/sites/default/files/documents/P_J_Evaluation.pdf" target="_blank"><p class="case-quote">Procedural justice research has shown that when defendants and litigants perceive the court process to be fair, they are more likely to comply with court orders and to follow the law in the future, <strong>regardless of whether they “win” or “lose” their case.</strong></p></a>

            <p class="">As such, procedural justice was a concept that we constantly used when empathizing with users.</p>
            <p class="">Needing a better understanding of the current divorce process, we collaborated with a local divorce firm and summarized their divorce process into six steps:</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.separation.ca/help-centre/separation/importance-of-financial-disclosure/" target="_blank">financial disclosure</a> (second step) is a holistic snapshot of a client's financial situation including assets, liabilities, expenses, etc. It typically involves the help of CDFAs, lawyers, and mediators. This step allows legal proceedings to divide financial components evenly among spouses in a divorce. Our research with the firm suggested that financial disclosure is the most painful step.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Competitive Heatmap Analysis</p>
            <p class="">To understand the legal-tech climate as it pertained to dispute resolution, we analysed eight other competitive solutions.</p>
            <p class="">We asked several legal professionals from our industry partner to rate each product on various features to formulate a heatmap (darker shades represent higher values).</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Empathy Maps</p>
            <p>Following the development of our two personas, we also used the observed interactions of the professionals and their clients to build empathy maps. This forces us to overcome personal biases and perceptions to map how our users actually felt during this process.</p>

            <p>For clients, we broke the process down into a screening questionnaire, followed by an ongoing checklist of the documents they needed to provide (in situations where the platform did not automatically source the documents through a secure API connection with a third party).</p>

          <p class="case-section-desc">Now that we specified potential solutions and goals, we quickly developed prototypes to visualize and quantify the experience we were proposing. This also allowed us to explore the information architecture and the sequential process of each task in greater detail.</p>

            <p>We specifically used the <a href="https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/bj-foggs-behavior-model/" target="_blank">Fogg-Behavioral model</a> and <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users" target="blank">Hick's law</a> for understanding how to increase client motivation for the completion of some more difficult tasks. We applied our understanding of these theories to develop wireframes for the platform and for particular interactions.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Lean Evaluation</p>
            <p>We gathered feedback regarding the wireframes through client-walkthroughs and interviews with professionals from our industry partner. With their experience conducting financial disclosures, they had excellent feedback regarding our innovation and insight into how a client might feel.</p>

            <p><strong>What Went Well</strong><br>
            Our participants liked the idea of simplifying the process to the client in steps and the way progress was always visualized in the interface. They especially liked that users had the option to do the screening interview themselves or with a professional leading them. Finally, they found that autofilling information from the disclosure into legal documents was extremely valuable.</p>

            <p><strong>What Could be Improved</strong><br>
            Moving forward, we needed to address user's concerns about integrating a client management system into the platform for multiple disclosures, the client's ability to edit and see submitted documents, and the professional's ability to keep track of related activities by collaborators.</p>

          <p class="case-section-desc">Before the next design iteration, it's imperative that we conduct summative research to examine our progress and the effectiveness of our prototype. We used the <a href="http://www.id-book.com/fourthedition/downloads/ID3Chapter13Anevaluationframework.pdf" target="_blank">DECIDE framework</a> and elements of procedural justice to validate any of our previous assumptions and examine the efficacy of the MVP.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Focus Group Role-Play Study</p>
            <p class="">We gathered five family law professionals from our industry partner as well as five participants who approximately fit the demographic of the client persona and had no experience with the financial disclosure process.</p>

            <p class="">To introduce the platform to the focus group, we asked both persona types to role-play a professional-client relationship and complete a financial disclosure with data provided via an information package. This included navigating the dashboard, as well as completing a client interview, checklist, file validation, and automatic legal document generation.</p>

            <p class="">After making observations and a brief feedback discussion, we also asked the participant to complete the <a href="https://measuringu.com/sus/" target="_blank">System Usability Scale</a>, a peer-reviewed and standardized measurement of usability where a score of <strong>68</strong> is considered average.</p>
            <p>Our mean SUS score was <strong>66</strong>, which was slightly below average. We believe our score was slightly lower than average given the complexity of our application; we used the data collected during evaluation to plan and prioritize a platform redesign.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Usability Analysis</p>
            <p class="">An expert review of our platform was conducted using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics</a>.</p>

            </a>

            <p class="">After noting examples of heuristic support, we specified the source of specific usability issues.</p>
            <p>Notably, we discovered that it was occasionally unclear what the user was supposed to do and some visual metaphors were unintuitive. Based on my <a href="./files/CFUX.pdf" target="_blank">previous research</a> and given the typical age and emotional state of the clients, we decided to rely more on textual and explicit descriptions.</p>

            <p class="case-subsection-title">Second Iteration</p>
            <p>Using the feedback from our evaluation session, we worked to simplify the platform further and make the interface more intuitive.</p>
            <p>One of our primary focuses was on redesigning the checklist portion - we organized the UI according to tasks that the client needs to do, tasks that the professional needs to do, and what has been completed. This highlights what the user needs to complete at any given time.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="">Lean evaluation with of the redesign showed that we improved the platform's SUS score to <strong>71</strong>, where the average standardized SUS score is <strong>68</strong>. Subsequent focus group discussions showed that the platform showed improvement in terms of the overall quality of experience as well.</p>

        <h3 class="case-reflection-title">Reflection</h3>
        <p>According to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIECXFXO7Hcfdk81L-ysmguwKzyEm4jj5PpoXhwO2aA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">cost evaluation</a> based on competitive analyses, this platform can help the user save <strong>86%</strong> of monetary expenses compared to the traditional process. By the end of this project, this platform also secured an official partnership with the <a href="https://www.oafm.on.ca/" target="_blank">Ontario Association for Family Mediation</a>. Along the way, I learned three key things that will extend to my future work:</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Keep it Quick, Keep it Agile</p>
        <p class="">Many aspects of user-centered design seem linear; just because we learn about different tools in school doesn't mean we have to use them for every project! Weigh the pros and cons and ship a MVP for quick, iterative prototyping.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Cross-Collaboration is Key</p>
        <p class="">Working in a small team allowed me to communicate with members beyond my scope of expertise. By learning more and more about their work, I was to understand their constraints and requirements to balance user needs with business needs.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Missed the Mark? Do it Again </p>
        <p class="">We felt distraught when we learned that weeks of research and hard work led to a subpar usability score. With a month left to redesign the platform, we applied lean UX principles with quick iterations to find success.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with this solution, we would like to analyse the platform longitudinally to verify that it saves time for our users compared to the traditional process. Additionally, we want to continue exploring deeper areas of brand customization to support buy-in from enterprise-level users and professionals who manage small teams on the platform.</p>
