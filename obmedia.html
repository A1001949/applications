          <h3 class="case-section-title">Defining the Problem <span class="hide">Space</span></h3>
          <p class="case-section-desc"><i><a href="https://obsoletemedia.org/" target="_blank">The Museum of Obsolete Media</a></i> is currently a content-based digital museum represented by an online exhibit. After a preliminary literature review, we wanted to analyse the website in-depth to find any areas for potential improvement. These were the key insights in our discovery process.</p>
          <div class="py-3"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-1 col-md-1 col-lg-1">
            <div class="case-section-side hide">

          <div class="vline"></div>
          <div class="col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 case-section-content">

            <p class="case-meta-title">Content Inventory</p>
            <p class="">To analyse the website, we initially conducted a content inventory using Content Auditor.</p>
            <p class="">In total, Content Auditor crawled <strong>93</strong> pages. This is a reasonable sample considering the size of the website. Moreover, many pages within the website has similar content, format, and data types. As such, we employed the <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=2d2Ry2hZc2MC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&dq=noah%27s+ark+approach+content+inventory&source=bl&ots=onihvo-Nzf&sig=ACfU3U2woNay5Ik5DTkVTJSrRB8AJQIfOA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirpo6Rv8_mAhWPnOAKHVePC8cQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=noah's%20ark%20approach%20content%20inventory&f=false" target="_blank">Noah’s Ark approach.</a></p>

            <p class="">Among our main findings, we discovered that the average reading grade was <strong>13.4</strong> and the average reading ease was <strong>46.4</strong> per page. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests" target="_blank">Flesch-Kincaid readability tests</a>, this is almost double the reading difficulty that is recommended.</p>

              <img src="./images/obmedia/barcharts.jpg" class="img-fluid zoomer" alt="bar chart image">
            </a>

            <p>Although users may be professionals or hobbyists with experience in obsolete media, new users may find this reading difficulty troubling. Ad-hoc analysis seems to show that this difficulty is distributed across the website relatively equally.</p>

            <p>Aside from content difficulty, we also found accessibility, SEO, and loading time issues. For example, there were <strong>1640</strong> broken links, <strong>98%</strong> of images had missing alt texts, and <strong>12</strong> pages had missing meta discriptions.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Current IA Schematic Diagram</p>
            <p>After our content inventory, we created a preliminary IA schematic diagram to outline the current status of the web museum.</p>

            <div class="py-2"></div>
            <a href="./images/obmedia/oldIA.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">

            <div class="py-4"></div>

            <p>In the following sections, we subsequently analysed the website in greater detail.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Organizational Analysis</p>
            <p class="">In a top-down way, the primary and secondary navigation links within the site are organized based on topical/categorical differences. When navigating within these links, individual artifacts are divided according to chronological differences.</p>
            <p>This may prove to be confusing for first-time visitors. Introducing bottom-up links on the front page may help new users understand where to start.</p>

            <div class="py-2"></div>
            <a href="./images/obmedia/buttomupsug.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
              <img src="./images/obmedia/buttomupsug.jpg" class="img-fluid outlined-img zoomer" alt="bottom-up suggestions image">
            </a>
            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Labeling Analysis</p>
            <p>The labelling systems are generally helpful throughout the website, though may sometimes be inconsistent. From a professional user’s perspective, these labels may seem logically indexed and are arguably easy to browse. Unfortunately, a new user or a novice hobbyist may not necessarily feel the same way.</p> 
            <p>Suggesting similar items may help the user understand these labels with the use of bottom-up architecture; specifically, popular tags, related tags, and similar formats.</p>

            <div class="py-2"></div>
            <a href="./images/obmedia/tags.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
              <img src="./images/obmedia/tags.jpg" class="img-fluid outlined-img zoomer" alt="tag system image">
            </a>
            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Navigation Analysis</p>
            <p>The persistence of the navigation bar implies that it is meant to be used to navigate the website at a top-down, global level. However, it does not indicate where the user is at the current moment. This point is further supported by the lack of breadcrumb trails. The site seems to rely heavily on supplementary navigation systems in deeper pages.</p>

            <div class="py-2"></div>
            <a href="./images/obmedia/nav.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
              <img src="./images/obmedia/nav.jpg" class="img-fluid outlined-img zoomer" alt="navbar image">

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Search System Analysis</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the search system does not offer the option to specify particular search zones. This may be argued as a reliance on the browsability of the subject hierarchy.</p>

            <p>As such, the search bar may be catered specifically to users who can define the information that they want. For the users that can't specify what they're looking for, the search system can be improved in terms of usability.</p>

          <h3 class="case-section-title">Understanding the User</h3>
          <p class="case-section-desc">Given that obsolete media is a relatively specific niche, we would expect the digital museum to have different kinds of users. Here, we brainstormed different user groups and analysed their interactions while using the current interface in order to identify areas of potential improvement.</p>
          <div class="py-3"></div>

        <div class="row">

            <p class="case-meta-title">Defining Target Users</p>
            <p>Our background research informed our brainstorming sessions where we grouped potential users into four segments according to their level of expertise.</p>
            <p>Then, we recruited four participants for each level of expertise using a mix of convenience and snowball sampling.</p>
            <p>The following proto-personas embody the average demographics and characteristics for each of the participants in all four expertise levels.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Timed Observational Study</p>
            <p>We asked our representative users to find more information regarding two target items from the website; specifically, magnetic tapes and phonograph discs.</p>
            <p>As our users searched for the target items, we recorded the time needed for completion and recorded any errors they made.</p>
            <p>Then, we averaged the recorded times and grouped them according to our proto-personas (differing levels of expertise in ascending order).</p>
            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <div class="row justify-content-between">

            </div>
            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p>We noticed that as was hypothesized, users with greater familiarity with obsolete media take less time to find the two targets.</p>
            <p>By observing the user's interactions, we also noticed that most of our users used the dropdown menus (top-down IA) to complete the task.</p>
            <p>The individuals who were most reliant on the search system were the users with the lowest level of expertise, which may have accounted for their increased time of completion and many errors.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Semi-Structured Interview</p>
            <p>After the participants finished the observational study and had some free time to explore the website themselves, we conducted semi-structured interviews.</p>
            <p>Once again, we aggregated their responses and grouped the primary findings according to the four proto-personas meant to represent the four varying levels of media expertise. This is a summary of their responses:</p>

          <h3 class="case-section-title">Analysing the Scope</h3>
          <p class="case-section-desc">After we developed a better understanding of how our users felt, we needed to specify how we would approach a potential solution. We conducted a card sort study with the previously described proto-personas which informed our proposed revisions and new IA schematic.</p>
          <div class="py-3"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 case-section-content">

            <p class="case-meta-title">Card Sort Study</p>
            <p>To get a better understanding of how these personas interacted with the digital museum and what we could improve, we conducted a open card sort. We used 30 labels in total, sourced from the current global navigation as well as prominent tags.</p>
            <p>Two participants were recruited to represent each proto-persona, for a total of eight responses. The following similarity matrix shows a summary of how different labels were grouped.</p>
            <div class="py-2"></div>

              <img src="./images/obmedia/simmatrix.jpg" class="img-fluid zoomer" alt="similarity matrix image">
            </a>
            <div class="py-4"></div>

            <p>After analysing the card sort, we found consistency between the <i>About</i> and the <i>Media Preservation</i> sections, indicating that the participants were able to intuitively group cards that concerned the metadata of the museum and obsolete media in general.</p>

            <p>However, we found inconsistency within the specific formats in the website, suggesting that the users had a shallow understanding of the particular types of media. This discrepency was even found amoung the participants with the greatest levels of expertise.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Proposed Revisions</p>
            <p>The seven following revisions were proposed in response to the results of the card sort, as well as the observations made in user analysis.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Single point of entry into collection<br><p>Our analysis so far indicates that a more effective interface would consolidate format types into a single button, providing entry to the museum’s primary content.</p></li>

              <li>Labelling system overhaul<br><p>Our proposed changes to the global navigation menu are based on card sort analysis that showed a clear distinction between items in the collection versus more general content.</p></li>

              <li>Collection filter toggles<br><p>By selecting toggles to hide or display certain traits, a user with any level of familiarity can narrow the collection to a more manageable size.</p></li>

              <li>Collection time-range slider<br><p>Separating the temporal metadata from other details is consistent with results from our card sort, in which we observed users distinguishing years from all other cards.</p></li>

              <li>Homepage curated suggestions<br><p>A sequential, curated journey would provide the context needed to dig deeper into the collection, manifesting as a guided tour of the museum for users without expertise.</p></li>

              <li>Search keyword identification<br><p>If a user searches for a keyword that exists as a collection filter, we propose a technical function that would invite users to instead apply that filter to the collection directly.</p></li>

              <li>Content suggestion mechanism<br><p>This mechanism will benefit those seeking to identify an item if their search isn’t perfectly accurate, drawing from users’ anecdotes about how similar many formats can seem. </p></li>
            </ol>

          <p class="case-section-desc">In order to visualize the proposed revisions and interactions with the new IA schematic, we created wireframe sketches to facilitate agile evaluation.

            <p class="case-meta-title">Lean Evaluation</p>
            <p>We showed our sketched wireframes to the participants of the user analysis as they had prior experience of the web museum, explaining the changes that we made and what they would need to do in order to complete certain tasks. We took note of the tasks they were interested in.</p>
            <p class="">We were also happy to find that participants unanimously felt that the infrastructure was accomodating for their demographic, even though their levels of expertise varied.</p>
            <p>Overall, users rated the wireframe highly on all seven facets of <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html" target="_blank">Peter Morville's honeycomb of UX</a>, especially in terms of findability.</p>

            <p>We conducted a tree test with three users per proto-persona to evaluate their ability to conceptually understand the steps needed to complete their respective user scenarios.</p>
            <p>Using a different set of participants, we also gathered feedback on the clickable prototype.

            <p>Users found it easy to contact the curator. However, there was minor contention as to whether information regarding media preservation should be in the <i>About</i> tab or should be kept separate.</p>

        <h3 class="case-reflection-title">Reflection</h3>
        <p class="">With observations and tree tests, we found evidence to suggest that our proposed revisions made significant improvements to the existing IA structure for users across expertise groups. Along the way, I learned three key things that will extend to my future work:</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-meta-title">Specify User Groups as Needed</p>
        <p class="">There is no <i>one size fits all</i> when it comes to something as complicated as a digital museum! There is value in subdividing personas into multiple personas when their experiences are fundamentally different.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-meta-title">Value the Narrative</p>
        <p class="">We tend to forget that we're designing experiences when we're working something as technical as information architecture. As UX practitioners, we have storytelling superpowers! Use them! Don't forget to base design decisions on the user's story.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-meta-title">UI Facilitates IA, Not the Other Way Around</p>
        <p class="">UX is not UI and UI is not IA! Working in UX, we tend to forget that most experiences are felt, not seen. Never rush to finish a visual interface, especially when the underlying infrastructure is flawed. Focus on the basics and flourish from there.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with these revisions, we would like to analyse the labelling system in greater depth. In terms of research, bias was possibly introduced through snowball sampling. Clustered sampling would be a better recruitment method but would require greater resources given the scarcity of media obsolescence experts.</p>
