          <p class="case-section-desc"><i><a href="https://obsoletemedia.org/" target="_blank">The Museum of Obsolete Media</a></i> is currently a content-based digital museum represented by an online exhibit. After a preliminary literature review, we wanted to analyse the website in-depth to find any areas for potential improvement. These were the key insights in our discovery process.</p>
          <div class="py-3"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3 vline">
            <div class="case-section-side hide">

          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9 case-section-content">

            <p class="case-meta-title">Content Inventory</p>
            <p class="">To analyse the website, we initially conducted a content inventory using Content Auditor.</p>
            <p class="">In total, Content Auditor crawled <strong>93</strong> pages. This is a reasonable sample considering the size of the website. Moreover, many pages within the website has similar content, format, and data types. As such, we employed the <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=2d2Ry2hZc2MC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&dq=noah%27s+ark+approach+content+inventory&source=bl&ots=onihvo-Nzf&sig=ACfU3U2woNay5Ik5DTkVTJSrRB8AJQIfOA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirpo6Rv8_mAhWPnOAKHVePC8cQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=noah's%20ark%20approach%20content%20inventory&f=false" target="_blank">Noah’s Ark approach.</a></p>

            <p class="">Among our main findings, we discovered that the average reading grade was <strong>13.4</strong> and the average reading ease was <strong>46.4</strong> per page. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests" target="_blank">Flesch-Kincaid readability tests</a>, this is almost double the reading difficulty that is recommended.</p>

            <img src="./images/obmedia/barcharts.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="bar chart image">

            <p>Although users may be professionals or hobbyists with experience in obsolete media, new users may find this reading difficulty troubling. Ad-hoc analysis seems to show that this difficulty is distributed across the website relatively equally.</p>

            <p>Aside from content difficulty, we also found accessibility, SEO, and loading time issues. For example, there were <strong>1640</strong> broken links, <strong>98%</strong> of images had missing alt texts, and <strong>12</strong> pages had missing meta discriptions.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Organizational Analysis</p>
            <p class="">In a top-down way, the primary and secondary navigation links within the site are organized based on topical/categorical differences. When navigating within these links, individual artifacts are divided according to chronological differences.</p>
            <p>This may prove to be confusing for first-time visitors. Introducing bottom-up links on the front page may help new users understand where to start.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Labeling Analysis</p>
            <p>The labelling systems are generally helpful throughout the website, though may sometimes be inconsistent. From a professional user’s perspective, these labels may seem logically indexed and are arguably easy to browse. Unfortunately, a new user or a novice hobbyist may not necessarily feel the same way.</p> 
            <p>Suggesting similar items may help the user understand these labels with the use of bottom-up architecture; specifically, popular tags, related tags, and similar formats.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Navigation Analysis</p>
            <p>The persistence of the navigation bar implies that it is meant to be used to navigate the website at a top-down, global level. However, it does not indicate where the user is at the current moment. This point is further supported by the lack of breadcrumb trails. The site seems to rely heavily on supplementary navigation systems in deeper pages.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Search System Analysis</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the search system does not offer the option to specify particular search zones. This may be argued as a reliance on the browsability of the subject hierarchy.</p>

            <p>As such, the search bar may be catered specifically to users who can define the information that they want. For the users that can't specify what they're looking for, the search system can be improved in terms of usability.</p>

          <h3 class="case-section-title">Understanding the User</h3>
          <p class="case-section-desc">The core principle of user-centered design is involving the user within every part of the process. Identifying our users and developing empathy for their struggles allows us to determine the direction of our solution as well as specify our KPIs and success metrics down the line.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Defining Target Users</p>
            <p>Our background research informed our brainstorming sessions where we grouped potential users into four segments according to their level of expertise.</p>
            <p>Then, we recruited four participants for each level of expertise using a mix of convenience and snowball sampling.</p>
            <p>The following proto-personas embody the average demographics and characteristics for each of the participants in all four expertise levels.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Timed Observational Study</p>
            <p>We asked our representative users to find more information regarding two target items from the website; specifically, magnetic tapes and phonograph discs.</p>
            <p>As our users searched for the target items, we recorded the time needed for completion and recorded any errors they made.</p>
            <p>Then, we averaged the recorded times and grouped them according to our proto-personas (differing levels of expertise in ascending order).</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p>We noticed that as was hypothesized, users with greater familiarity with obsolete media take less time to find the two targets.</p>
            <p>By observing the user's interactions, we also noticed that most of our users used the dropdown menus (top-down IA) to complete the task.</p>
            <p>The individuals who were most reliant on the search system were the users with the lowest level of expertise, which may have accounted for their increased time of completion and many errors.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Semi-Structured Interview</p>
            <p>After the participants finished the observational study and had some free time to explore the website themselves, we conducted semi-structured interviews.</p>
            <p>Once again, we aggregated their responses and grouped the primary findings according to the four proto-personas meant to represent the four varying levels of media expertise. This is a summary of their responses:</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Prioritizing Ideas</p>
            <p>Sam's needs statements helped us brainstorm many ideas that would address her pain points. We weren't worried about whether the idea was absurd or unreasonable because value can be found in even the worst of ideas.</p>
            <p>Using sticky notes allowed us to group each idea into their thematic clusters easily. We found that most of our ideas were related to some kind of logistics management, where the responsibility of scheduling was given to someone or something else. Other groups emerged and included school allocated time, incentivization, punishments, sharing availabilities, randomized scheduling, and automated replies for the unavailable.</p>
            <p>Then, we voted on our ideas based on their impact and feasibility and plotted them along a prioritization grid. Our votes were based on the bigger picture and whether or not we could derive insight from the idea, as opposed to interpreting the idea literally.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">To-Be Scenario</p>
            <p>We reimagined how Sam's as-is scenario would look like if she was able to use our ideas.</p>
            <p>This is called the To-Be scenario because it guides our efforts and strategy for improving the process that Sam currently needs to go through.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Quantifying Hills</p>
            <p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/hills" target="_blank">design thinking principles outlined by IBM</a>, hills statements allow us to set clear goals for our solution while being implementation-agnostic.</p>
            <p>They are typically structured according to who the user is, what is the need they're trying to meet, and the measurable wow statement that differentiates our solution from current competitors'.</p>
            <p>The three following hills were derived from a set of twenty after a rigorous elimination and voting process.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Sam will be able to see her groupmates’ up-to-date schedules because schedules will be updated automatically.</li>
              <li>Sam and her group can easily come to a consensus of a meetup time without going back and forth in discussions or worrying about being the odd one out.</li>
              <li>Sam will be able to finalize a meeting schedule that all of her groupmates can be happy with in less than 10 minutes.</li>

          <p class="case-section-desc">Now that we specified potential solutions and goals, we quickly developed prototypes to visualize and quantify the experience we were proposing. This also allowed us to explore the information architecture and the sequential process of each task in greater detail.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Low Fidelity Prototype</p>
            <p>We developed a paper prototype for our MVP based on our established hills.</p>
            <p>We each brainstormed features that could be used to achieve these hills initially, then converged our findings to remove redundancy. Using these features, we diverged and converged once more to ideate on potential screens and process flows.</p>
            <p>By the end of the discussion, we devised a nine-screen process that highlights the primary function of the minimum viable product.</p>
            <img src="./images/avail/lofi.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img" alt="lo-fi prototype image">

            <p>This solution was meant to fulfill our first hill by being automatically integrated with the University system's API, such that any enrolled courses and any University-related events would automatically update in our solution.</p>
            <p>By allowing our users to vote on their preferred meeting time, they wouldn't need to negotiate back-and-forth in chat, thereby achieving the second hill.</p>
            <p>Finally, we were hoping that this entire process would be much simpler than Sam's as-is scenario. As a result, we would accomplish the third hill by reducing the amount of time needed to schedule a meeting, from 30 minutes to under 10.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Lean Evaluation</p>
            <p>We conducted <i>Wizard of Oz</i> usability testing with a paper prototype to quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of the initial iteration. We also asked our participants to engage in a think-aloud protocol as they went through the main function of the application (creating a group and scheduling a meeting).</p>
            <p class="">We briefly screened our participants and defined our inclusion criteria. In total, we had four final participants who were either recent alumni or current undergraduate students whom experienced multiple group projects which required them meeting at least four other students in-person.</p>
            
            <p class="">Our participants seemed to like how easy it was to set up a group, the aggregation of every member's calendar into a single group calendar, and the ability to confirm a meeting time which was similar to RSVPing to an event.</p>

            <p class="">Moving forward, we needed to address user's concerns about keeping their own day-to-day activities private, the redundancy of a voting system given the final confirmation, integrating non-University events, and the clarity of particular labels.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Mid Fidelity Prototype</p>
            <p>Using the feedback from our users, we developed a mid-fidelity prototype in Figma.</p>
            <img src="./images/avail/midfi.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img" alt="midfi storyboard image">
            <p>We took precautions regarding privacy in this iteration of the prototype. Users have the option to set a password before invited members can join the group, and unavailable times shown on the calendar have become anonymous.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we removed the voting feature as it was found to be redundant. Instead, the solution suggests the first available meeting time the instant everyone joins the group.</p>
            <p>We also considered the integration of other calendar services to allow for non-University related events to propagate the personal calendar within the MVP.</p>
            <p>Finally, we renamed the <i>Results</i> section to <i>Options</i> and clarified the UI of the tabs. <i>Options</i> is different from <i>Results</i> in that instead of relying on user votes, the application will make smart suggestions (or options) based on the characteristics of the time slots. This may include recommending the longest meeting time, the shortest meeting time, or the time slot that was previously picked by the user.</p>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Methodology</p>
            <p class="">To evaluate our mid-fidelity prototype, we used a mixed-methods approach to examine the overall UX of the application.</p>
            <p class="">Using the inclusion criteria listed previously, we met with four participants in at a quiet location where we could talk face-to-face individually. The research session would consist of a timed observation of the user interacting with the product and attempting to complete three primary tasks, a semi-structured interview, and a brief questionnaire.</p>
            <p>The three tasks were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Sync your personal calendar with the application</li>
              <li>Create a group and find a suitable meeting time</li>
              <li>Confirm an additional meeting time within an existing group</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="py-1"></div>
            <p>For the duration of the study, we asked the participant to use their own smartphone, so that they could interact with our prototype using a device they were already accustomed to. This also allows us to pin-point problems of usability on the interface itself, as oppose to learning how to use a new device.</p>
            <p class="">Then, we organized the gathered data according to the user's subjective experience of using the application and more quantifiable aspects of usability.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>
            <p class="case-meta-title">Experience Analysis</p>
            <p class="">After interacting with the prototype, we asked the participants to rate their overall satisfaction with each task out of five.</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-between">
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center">
                <h1 class="mb-1">3.75<span class="small text-muted"> /5</span></h1>
                <p>Task 1</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center">
                <h1 class="mb-1">5<span class="small text-muted"> /5</span></h1>
                <p>Task 2</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center">
                <h1 class="mb-1">2.5<span class="small text-muted"> /5</span></h1>
                <p>Task 3</p>
              </div>            
            </div>
            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="">Users found that syncing their personal calendar with Avail was relatively unambiguous but suggested improvements to the clarity of the icons. When asked, they were unsure whether the calendar would automatically sync with the system or if it needed to be synced by the user every time. Moving forward, we need to clarify this point in order to achieve our first hill.</p>
            <p class="">We were happy to find that users unanimously agreed that creating a group and finding a suitable meeting time was easy and straightforward. Users were especially satisfied with how quick it was to find a common meeting time - this was their <i>AHA</i> moment.</p>
            <p class="">Participants found difficulty when trying to confirm an additional meeting time. They felt that it was pointless to separate the options from the primary tab and also felt that the calendar should be interactive (i.e. users tried to confirm a meeting time by clicking directly on a blank area on the calendar) since it was in the default tab.</p>

            <p class="">Finally, users were asked if they would need to resort back to negotiating meeting times after using Avail. All four users mentioned that they would only need to do so in very rare circumstances. In this sense, we were able to achieve our second hill.</p>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="case-meta-title">Usability Assessment</p>
            <p class="">Since we timed the user's completion of the three tasks separately, we were able to assess the usability of the MVP as well as whether it fulfilled our final hill of finalizing a meetup schedule in less than 10 minutes.</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-between">
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center text-muted ">
                <h1 class="mb-1">27s</h1>
                <p>Task 1</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center text-muted ">
                <h1 class="mb-1">34s</h1>
                <p>Task 2</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 text-center text-muted ">
                <h1 class="mb-1">1m 46s</h1>
                <p>Task 3</p>
              </div>            
            </div>

            <div class="py-3"></div>

            <p class="">Since our prototype was designed to follow a happy path, we don't anticipate that these times would reflect real-world interactions perfectly. However, even if we were to double, triple, or even quadruple these times, our third hill is still met and the time needed to finalize a meeting was significantly less than 10 minutes.</p>

            <p class="">We also asked the participant to complete the <a href="https://measuringu.com/sus/" target="_blank">System Usability Scale</a>, a peer-reviewed and standardized measurement of usability where a score of <strong>68</strong> is considered average. Our mean SUS score was <strong>79.38</strong>. We believe our score was relatively high given the simplicity of our application; we anticipate this score to decrease as we introduce more features in future iterations but are optimistic of the current results.</p>

        <p class="">Don't follow what users say blindly, but rather interpret their suggestions appropriately to focus on what users actually want and what users actually need (e.g. privacy, simplicity).</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-meta-title">Avoid Working in a Silo</p>
        <p class="">As was also suggested in our secondary research, our best work was done when everyone was present in person and communicating effectively. Like Sam, we had to deal with scheduling logistics as well, but that didn't stop us!</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-meta-title">Keep an Open Mind</p>
        <p class="">Facing criticism and unexpected research findings give way for growth and will lead to the design and development of a great solution. Recognize  biases (confirmation bias, observer biases, response biases) to avoid them.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with this solution, we would like to extend our mid-fi assessment to develop a higher-fidelity prototype with additional features to test beyond the happy path, such as incorporating locations, direct interaction with the main calendar, and exporting data to other applications (such as Facebook Messenger). We would also like to extend our findings to larger sample sizes and populations outside of the University of Toronto in order to pitch this solution to scale.</p>
