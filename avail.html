          <div class="thinline"></div>
          <p class="case-section-desc">We've partnered with the <a href="http://blogs.studentlife.utoronto.ca/innovationhub/" target="_blank">Innovation Hub</a> at the University of Toronto to improve student experiences. Our key challenge was to improve project management dynamics, specifically in terms of student collaboration. These were the key insights in our user discovery process.</p>

        <div class="case-section-content">
          <p class="case-subsection-title">Secondary Research</p>
          <p class="">According to <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2a8/ad07ef79db2ba040fd09f4f152794d7eb627.pdf?_ga=2.78510164.1576314777.1576397611-300708698.1576397611" target="_blank">Sugumaran et al. (2006)</a>, a human’s natural resource allocation does not cater to the kind of information handling that is required to process multiple, independent schedules and to derive the most ideal time for a meeting. </p>

          <p>As such, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/04aaais-liz.pdf" target="_blank">Crawford & Veloso (2004)</a> suggest that the most common approach to scheduling meetups is currently one based entirely in compromise.</p> 

          <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/challenges.html" target="_blank"><p class="case-quote">If coordination costs are excessive or are not factored into the structure of group assignments, groups tend to miss deadlines, their work is poorly integrated, motivation suffers, and creativity declines.</p></a>

          <p>Although alternative solutions like Doodle, Calendly, and TimeTree currently exist, students have complained that these tools are difficult to set-up. Students also experienced push-back when suggesting the use of these apps from teammates who were unfamiliar with these solutions.</p>

          <p>In addition, students had a tendency to resort back to negotiating meeting times through the use of online chat, defeating the value of such tools in the first place.</p>

          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Primary Research</p>
          <p class="">We conducted face-to-face interviews (n=10) and an online survey (n=42) to collect both qualitative and quantitative data to gather a comprehensive understanding of the problem space.</p>
          <p class="">Our initial survey findings suggested that participants rated meeting scheduling to be the most difficult aspect of group work.</p>

          <a href="./images/avail/barchart.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./images/avail/barchart.jpg" class="img-fluid zoomer" alt="bar chart image">
          </a>

          <p class="">Probing into this problem space further, we found that about <strong>64.3%</strong> of people indicated that they would take 30 minutes or more to schedule a meeting.</p>
          <p class="">This is quite significant given that  around <strong>87.1%</strong> of students met with their groups at least once or twice a week for about an hour.</p>

            <img src="./images/avail/piecharts.jpg" class="img-fluid zoomer" alt="pie chart image">
          </a>

          <p>We used thematic analysis and an affinity diagram to interpret qualitative data. Seven primary themes emerged from analysis after clustering.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Representative Persona</p>
          <p>Using data from our research, we brainstormed a proto-persona with a focus on habits, demographics, desires, obstacles, and needs.</p>
          <p>We then revised our proto-persona to focus on particular actionable characteristics. Here's our  finalized persona - I'd like to introduce you to Sam the Student!</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Empathy Mapping</p>
          <p>Through our persona and user research, we were able to develop empathy when thinking about how students typically plan group meetings.</p>
          <p>Using an empathy map, we found that Sam would feel extremely frustrated in large groups. This is especially the case when one member of her group is late to the meeting or flops entirely.</p>

            <img src="./images/avail/empathymap.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="empathymap image">
          </a>
          <p>As a student, she feels cheated because tuition is expensive and she shouldn't be paying to learn how to deal with team logistics or drama.</p>
          <p>She just wants to be productive and get work done.</p>

          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">As-Is (Descriptive) Scenario</p>
          <p>We combined Sam's as-is scenario with a journey map to understand her process when she wants to schedule a meeting for her group project.</p>
          <p>We also voted on major areas of opportunity based on the severity of the issue as well as the amount of times the pain point was mentioned during research.</p>
          <a href="./images/avail/asis.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./images/avail/asis.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="asis scenario image">
          </a>

          <p>We learned that Sam feels like she's wasting her time overcomplicating the logistics of coordinating meetings with her group. Sam is also interested in using a service or tool that her group members already use, without having to set-up a new account or a subscription plan.</p>
          <p>In this sense, it is crucial that a solution offers her convenience and accessibility.</p>

          <p>By breaking down the scheduling process further, we were able to diverge this needs statement into four unique needs statements.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Prioritizing Ideas</p>
          <p>Sam's needs statements helped us brainstorm many ideas that would address her pain points. Using sticky notes allowed us to group each idea into their thematic clusters easily.</p>
          <p>Then, we voted on our ideas based on their impact and feasibility and plotted them along a prioritization grid. Our votes were based on the bigger picture and whether or not we could derive insight from the idea, as opposed to interpreting the idea literally.</p>

          <!--Three features turn to new features - integration with uni, see unified availability, option voting-->

          <p class="case-subsection-title">To-Be (Perscriptive) Scenario</p>
          <p>We reimagined how Sam's as-is scenario would look like if she was able to use our ideas.</p>
          <p>This is called the To-Be scenario because it guides our efforts and strategy for improving the process that Sam currently needs to go through.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Quantifying Goals</p>
          <p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/hills" target="_blank">design thinking principles outlined by IBM</a>, hills statements allow us to set clear goals for our solution while being implementation-agnostic.</p>
          <p>The three following hills were derived from a set of twenty after a rigorous elimination and voting process.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sam will be able to see her groupmates’ up-to-date schedules because schedules will be updated automatically.</li>
            <li>Sam and her group can easily come to a consensus of a meetup time without going back and forth in discussions or worrying about being the odd one out.</li>
            <li>Sam will be able to finalize a meeting schedule that all of her groupmates can be happy with in less than 10 minutes.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 class="case-section-title">Designing the Solution</h3>
          <div class="thinline"></div>
          <p class="case-section-desc">Now that we specified potential solutions and goals, we quickly developed prototypes to visualize and quantify the experience we were proposing. This also allowed us to explore the information architecture and the sequential process of each task in greater detail.</p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="case-section-content">

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Low Fidelity Prototype</p>
          <p>We each brainstormed features that could be used to achieve our user-centered goals, then converged our findings to remove redundancy. Using these features, we diverged and converged once more to ideate on potential screens and sequential storyboards.</p>

            <img src="./images/avail/lofi.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="lo-fi prototype image">
          </a>
          <p><strong>Design Hill #1</strong><br>
          This solution was meant to fulfill our first hill by being automatically integrated with the University system's API, such that any enrolled courses and any University-related events would automatically update in our solution.</p>

          <p><strong>Design Hill #2</strong><br>
          By allowing our users to vote on their preferred meeting time, they wouldn't need to negotiate back-and-forth in chat, thereby achieving the second hill.</p>

          <p><strong>Design Hill #3</strong><br>
          Finally, we were hoping that this entire process would be much simpler than Sam's as-is scenario. As a result, we would accomplish the third hill by reducing the amount of time needed to schedule a meeting, from 30 minutes to under 10.</p>

          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Lean Evaluation</p>
          <p>We conducted <i>Wizard of Oz</i> and guerilla usability testing with a paper prototype to quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of the initial iteration. We also asked our participants to engage in a think-aloud protocol as they went through the main function of the application (creating a group and scheduling a meeting).</p>
          
          <p><strong>What Went Well</strong><br>
          Our participants seemed to like how easy it was to set up a group, the aggregation of every member's calendar into a single group calendar, and the ability to confirm a meeting time which was similar to RSVPing to an event.</p>

          <p><strong>What Could be Improved</strong><br>
          Moving forward, we needed to address user's concerns about keeping their own day-to-day activities private, the redundancy of a voting system given the final confirmation, integrating non-University events, and the clarity of particular labels.</p>

          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Mid Fidelity Prototype</p>
          <p>Using the feedback from our users, we developed a mid-fidelity prototype in Figma.</p>
          <a href="./images/avail/midfi.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./images/avail/midfi.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="midfi storyboard image">
          </a>
          <!--Three features turn to new features - increased integration, privacy, automated suggestions-->
          <p><strong>User Privacy</strong><br>
          We took precautions regarding privacy in this iteration of the prototype. Users have the option to set a password before invited members can join the group, and unavailable times shown on the calendar have become anonymous.</p>

          <p><strong>Instant Suggestion</strong><br>
          Moreover, we removed the voting feature as it was found to be redundant. Instead, the solution suggests the first available meeting time the instant everyone joins the group.</p>

          <p><strong>Calendar Integrations</strong><br>We also considered the integration of other calendar services to allow for non-University related events to propagate the personal calendar within the MVP.</p>

          <p><strong>Smart Options</strong><br>
          Finally, we renamed the <i>Results</i> section to <i>Options</i> and clarified the UI of the tabs. Instead of relying on user votes, the application will make smart suggestions (or options). This includes the longest meeting time, the shortest meeting time, or the time slot that was previously picked by the user.</p>

      <div class="case-section" id="evaluation">
        <div class="case-section-intro">
          <h3 class="case-section-title">Verifying the Efficacy</h3>
          <div class="thinline"></div>
          <p class="case-section-desc">Before the next design iteration, it's imperative that we conduct summative research to examine our progress and the effectiveness of our mid-fidelity solution. We used the <a href="http://www.id-book.com/fourthedition/downloads/ID3Chapter13Anevaluationframework.pdf" target="_blank">DECIDE framework</a> to validate any of our previous assumptions and examine the efficacy of the MVP.</p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="case-section-content">
          <p class="case-subsection-title">Methodology</p>
          <p class="">To evaluate our mid-fidelity prototype, we used a mixed-methods approach to examine the overall UX of the application.</p>
          <p class="">We met with four participants in at a quiet location where we could talk face-to-face individually. The research session would consist of a timed observation of the user interacting with the product and attempting to complete three primary tasks, a semi-structured interview, and a brief questionnaire.</p>
          <div class="py-1"></div>
          <p>For the duration of the study, we asked the participant to use their own smartphone, so that they could interact with our prototype using a device they were already accustomed to. This also allows us to pin-point problems of usability on the interface itself, as oppose to using an unfamiliar device.</p>

          <div class="py-3"></div>
          <p class="case-subsection-title">Experience Analysis</p>
          <p class="">After interacting with the prototype, we asked the participants to rate their overall satisfaction with each task out of five.</p>
          <div class="row justify-content-around">
            <div class="text-center">
              <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">3.75<span class="small text-muted"> /5</span></h1>
              <p>Task 1</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center">
              <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">5<span class="small text-muted"> /5</span></h1>
              <p>Task 2</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center">
              <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">2.5<span class="small text-muted"> /5</span></h1>
              <p>Task 3</p>
            </div>            
          </div>
          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p><strong>Task 1 - Sync your personal calendar with the application</strong><br>
          Users found that syncing their personal calendar with Avail was relatively unambiguous but suggested improvements to the clarity of the icons. When asked, they were unsure whether the calendar would automatically sync with the system or if it needed to be synced by the user every time. Moving forward, we need to clarify this point in order to achieve our first hill.</p>

          <p><strong>Task 2 - Create a group and find a suitable meeting time</strong><br>
          We were happy to find that users unanimously agreed that creating a group and finding a suitable meeting time was easy and straightforward. Users were especially satisfied with how quick it was to find a common meeting time - this was their <i>AHA</i> moment.</p>

          <p><strong>Task 3 - Confirm an additional meeting time within an existing group</strong><br>
          Participants found difficulty when trying to confirm an additional meeting time. They felt that it was pointless to separate the options from the primary tab and also felt that the calendar should be interactive (i.e. users tried to confirm a meeting time by clicking directly on a blank area on the calendar) since it was in the default tab.</p>

          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Usability Assessment</p>
          <p class="">Since we timed the user's completion of the three tasks separately, we were able to assess the usability of the MVP as well as whether it fulfilled our final hill of finalizing a meetup schedule in less than 10 minutes.</p>
          <div class="row justify-content-around">
            <div class="text-center text-muted ">
              <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">27s</h1>
              <p>Task 1</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center text-muted ">
              <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">34s</h1>
              <p>Task 2</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center text-muted ">
              <h1 class="mb-1 p-font">1m 46s</h1>
              <p>Task 3</p>
            </div>            
          </div>

          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="">We also asked the participant to complete the <a href="https://measuringu.com/sus/" target="_blank">System Usability Scale</a>, a peer-reviewed and standardized measurement of usability where a score of <strong>68</strong> is considered average.</p>
          <p>Our mean SUS score was <strong>79.38.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="case-reflection-title">Reflection</h3>
        <div class="thinline"></div>
        <p class="">Overall, this two-month long project was based on the assumption that scheduling group meetings was a difficult and inefficient task. We were able to verify this idea using research and ultimately, we were also able to address this problem through the ideation of a potential solution. Along the way, I learned three key things that will extend to my future work:</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Interpret Data with Caution</p>
        <p class="">Don't follow what users say blindly, but rather interpret their suggestions appropriately to focus on what users actually want and what users actually need (e.g. privacy, simplicity).</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Avoid Working in a Silo</p>
        <p class="">As was also suggested in our secondary research, our best work was done when everyone was present in person and communicating effectively. Like Sam, we had to deal with scheduling logistics as well, but that didn't stop us!</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Keep an Open Mind</p>
        <p class="">Facing criticism and unexpected research findings give way for growth and will lead to the design and development of a great solution. Recognize  biases (confirmation bias, observer biases, response biases) to avoid them.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with this solution, we would like to extend our mid-fi assessment to develop a higher-fidelity prototype with additional features to test beyond the happy path, such as incorporating locations, direct interaction with the main calendar, and exporting data to other applications (such as Facebook Messenger). We would also like to extend our findings to larger sample sizes and populations outside of the University of Toronto in order to pitch this solution to scale.</p>
