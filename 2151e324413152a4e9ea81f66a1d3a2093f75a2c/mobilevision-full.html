          <p class="case-subsection-title">Homework Assignment</p>
          <p>We specifically used the <a href="https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/bj-foggs-behavior-model/" target="_blank">Fogg-Behavioral model</a> and <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users" target="blank">Hick's law</a> for understanding how to increase client motivation for the completion of some more difficult tasks. We applied our understanding of these theories to develop wireframes for the platform and for particular interactions.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Empathy Interviews</p>
          <p>We gathered feedback regarding the wireframes through client-walkthroughs and interviews with professionals from our industry partner. With their experience conducting financial disclosures, they had excellent feedback regarding our innovation and insight into how a client might feel.</p>

          <p><strong>What Went Well</strong><br>
          Our participants liked the idea of simplifying the process to the client in steps and the way progress was always visualized in the interface. They especially liked that users had the option to do the screening interview themselves or with a professional leading them. Finally, they found that autofilling information from the disclosure into legal documents was extremely valuable.</p>

          <div class="py-1"></div>

          <p><strong>What Could be Improved</strong><br>
          Moving forward, we needed to address user's concerns about integrating a client management system into the platform for multiple disclosures, the client's ability to edit and see submitted documents, and the professional's ability to keep track of related activities by collaborators.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Designing Personas</p>
          <p class="">We gathered five family law professionals from our industry partner as well as five participants who approximately fit the demographic of the client persona and had no experience with the financial disclosure process.</p>

          <p class="">After noting examples of heuristic support, we specified the source of specific usability issues.</p>
          <p>Notably, we discovered that it was occasionally unclear what the user was supposed to do and some visual metaphors were unintuitive. Based on my <a href="./files/CFUX.pdf" target="_blank">previous research</a> and given the typical age and emotional state of the clients, we decided to rely more on textual and explicit descriptions.</p>

        <h3 class="case-section-title">Reflection</h3>
        <div class="thinline"></div>
        <p>According to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIECXFXO7Hcfdk81L-ysmguwKzyEm4jj5PpoXhwO2aA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">cost evaluation</a> based on competitive analyses, this platform can help the user save <strong>86%</strong> of monetary expenses compared to the traditional process. By the end of this project, this platform also secured an official partnership with the <a href="https://www.oafm.on.ca/" target="_blank">Ontario Association for Family Mediation</a>. Along the way, I learned three key things that will extend to my future work:</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Keep it Quick, Keep it Agile</p>
        <p class="">Many aspects of user-centered design seem linear; just because we learn about different tools in school doesn't mean we have to use them for every project! Weigh the pros and cons and ship a MVP for quick, iterative prototyping.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Cross-Collaboration is Key</p>
        <p class="">Working in a small team allowed me to communicate with members beyond my scope of expertise. By learning more and more about their work, I was to understand their constraints and requirements to balance user needs with business needs.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Missed the Mark? Do it Again </p>
        <p class="">We felt distraught when we learned that weeks of research and hard work led to a subpar usability score. With a month left to redesign the platform, we applied lean UX principles with quick iterations to find success.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with this solution, we would like to analyse the platform longitudinally to verify that it saves time for our users compared to the traditional process. Additionally, we want to continue exploring deeper areas of brand customization to support buy-in from enterprise-level users and professionals who manage small teams on the platform.</p>
