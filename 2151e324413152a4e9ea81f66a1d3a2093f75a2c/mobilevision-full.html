          <p class="case-section-desc">Capital One is a company that prides itself by helping Canadians succeed with credit. Their digital channels provide a way for customers to manage their accounts and self-serve when needed. As a result, declaring a mobile vision was imperative for the success of the larger business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-section-content">
          <p class="case-subsection-title">Mobile Vision</p>
          <p>As senior leaders recognized the growing popularity of mobile  as customer's channel of choice year over year, the Capital One mobile app needed to evolve with users' growing needs.</p>
        
          <a href="./mobilegrowth.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./mobilegrowth.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="growth of mobile image">
          </a>
          <p> However, the organization didn't have a unified vision that was grounded in user data. Any strategy to increase mobile adoption and grow digital engagement would need sufficent user research that took both an internal and external lens.</p>
          <div class="py-3"></div>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Channel One</p>
          <p class="">A cross-collaborative team involving design, development, product, and research was established to tackle this key imperative. We called ourselves <strong>Channel One</strong>.</p>
          <p class="">My involvement among the team was to lead and support user research to help them define this mobile-first strategy. More broadly, Channel One's goals were as follows:</p>
          <img src="./goal.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="project goal image">
          <p class="">With this project goal, we introduced a strategic research roadmap that would help us define the particular experiences we needed to prioritize in order to optimize the mobile experience and grow it's user-base.</p>

          <p>Before we decided to conduct any net new research, we felt it was important to get an understanding of the research that was already conducted on the mobile experience so far.</p>
          <p>By conducting secondary research and organizing past insights, we were able to justify the need for new research as we discovered that past studies focussed heavily on individual features rather than the holistic experience. </p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p>After reviewing secondary sources, we felt it was imperative to get an understanding of the competitive landscape. This allowed us to understand which features where considered tablestakes, differentiators, and how we currently measured against alternatives.</p>

          <p>From this analysis, we hypothesized that customers would feel that Capital One offered a market-comparable experience with differentiators specifically within the payments space. </p>
          <p>However, our mobile experience lacked features that helped users review their financial situations including what offers were availble to them.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Initial Barriers Survey</p>
          <p>Using past insights, we were able to brainstorm several potential challenges that would inform a brief survey to gauge high-level barriers to digital adoption.</p>
          <p>We then distributed a brief survey among customers and prospects (n=944; nationally representative Canadians 18+) to gauge barriers to digital adoption.</p>

          </a>
          <p>We learned that there was a statistically significant age gap, where older users were less likely to have online banking. Moreover, customers with lower credit scores (Build) were significantly more likely to access their accounts through their mobile devices than customers with higher credit scores (Upmarket). We hypothesized that those who were in the Build subsegments corresponded to younger age groups and experienced a <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/digital-generation-gap/7632#:~:text=The%20digital%20generation%20gap%20refers,more%20successfully%20than%20older%20generations." target="_blank">digital generation gap.</a></p>

          <p>Following this initial analysis, we wanted to establish an understanding of the challenges internal stakeholders (i.e. contributors) face when trying to build solutions on the mobile platform. This was important as with any actionable insights surfaced, we wanted to understand potential limitations. </p>
          <p>After 40 interviews with stakeholders across different teams, we organized insights according to organizational inertia, contributor challenges, and platform challenges.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Planning the Research</p>
          <p>Although we conducted an initial survey with customers to understand potential barriers, a key limitation was that our segmentation was too broad and quantitative research only answers the "what"; we were unable to identify a deeper-level understanding of who our customers are and why they choose to be digital versus analog.</p>
          <p>We defined two new research objectives that would be addressed by empathy interviews:</p>

            <img src="./objectives.png" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="research objectives image">
          </a>
          <p>We planned to talk to each of the core segments to understand their nuanced approach to account management. In order to better understand these customers, we also introduced a homework assignemnt to be completed prior to the interviews, and designed a prototype of the mobile app to walk participants through. We spoke to 21 participants in total.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Homework Assignment</p>
          <p>In the homework assignment, we asked participants to indicate particular account management behaviours to track the relative frequency of certain events. This gave us a baseline understanding of self-reported behaviours to compare among segments and to reference during interviews.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Empathy Interviews</p>
          <p>Afterwards, participants joined us for an hour-long discussion about their account management behaviours, why they decided to manage their account in certain ways, build empathy for particular barriers of mobile adoption, as well as a walkthrough of the mobile app to gauge initial reactions.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Collborative Synthesis</p>
          <p>After facilitating these interviews, we decided to engage stakeholders in a collaborative synthesis session. This helped to socialize initial findings and democratize insight generation through thematic clustering. It also helped us summarize any observed patterns across the segments so that we could have a unified view of how these segments were represented.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, we organized our findings according to four key insights:</p>

            <img src="./insights.png" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="four insights image">
          </a>
          <p>In summary, we developed a newfound recognition for the importance of <strong>digital onboarding</strong> for new customers, as it preceded the habit formation of analog behaviours.</p>
          <p>We also discovered opportunities for analog customers to adopt digital channels in latter stages of their journey, as exposure to the mobile stimuli led users to find significant value and a strong interest in its features. However, the key was to design experiences that would be explicit in terms of how they could potentially replace and improve upon analog methods that had already been established.</p>

          <p class="case-section-desc">After empathy interviews, we wanted to converge and synthesize our data once again in order to understand its impact on our broader Channel One strategy.</p>

        <div class="case-section-content">
          <p class="case-subsection-title">Designing Personas</p>
          <p class="">We felt a promising way to convert raw data from the interviews (plus behavioural analytics from data science) was to combine both quantitative and qualitative insights into pseudo-personas for each of the segments.</p>

          <a href="./personas.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./personas.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="persona diagram image">
          </a>

          <p class="">In doing so, we were able to adequately socialize our digital segments across the org and help associates build empathy for our customers. A year later, these personas still remain a key artifact that intent teams reference regularly in their roadmaps.</p>

        <div class="case-section-content">
          <p class="case-subsection-title">Comprehensive Task Mapping</p>
          <p class="">Now that we understood a that customers need a way to replace analog methods before converting to digital, we decided to map all tasks and jobs a customer could accomplish across the different channels we offered.</p>

            <img src="./mapping.png" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="jobs mapping image">
          </a>

          <p class="">In particular, we scored each channel based on the number of tasks a customer could accomplish and in consideration of the relative importance of each task. We discovered that the mobile app had several key journey points that needed to be optimized in order to remain competitive among other Capital One platforms.</p>

          <p class="">After ideating and refining channel initiatives into key features on the mobile platform, we decided to gather quantitative user data in order to gauge which would provide the most user value. </p>
          <p>This user-centered approach would help us ground our mobile strategy for the forseeable future in terms of deciding which experiences were necessary for the growth of the mobile app. We decided to apply both a MaxDiff and Kano exercise to gain a rank-order and categorical perspective on our list of ideated features.</p>

          </a>
          <p class="">We distributed this survey to 509 Capital One customers and programmed the survey such that participants evaluated all 18 features through a MaxDiff exercise and then were asked to evaluate a sub-set of 9 of the 18 features (selected randomly for each participant) using a Kano Analysis exercise.</p>

          <p class="case-section-desc">By building empathy with our users through quantitative and qualitative means, we were able to work with the design team to finalize a clear direction for our mobile app.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Grounding the Mobile Vision</p>
          <p class="">We aggregated the feedback we gathered in empathy interviews as well as our prioritized features to postulate key imperatives for our mobile experience. In summary, in order to sustain growth and encourage digital engagement, our mobile app had to be:</p>

            <img src="./result1.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="result 1 revised image">
          </a>
          <p class="">In our research, we consistently discovered that our mobile experience lacked features that help customers review their financial situation. By designing <strong>personalized</strong> experiences, customers can ensure they know exactly how they're doing, and what to do next.</p>
          <a href="./result2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./result2.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="result 2 revised image">
          </a>
          <p class="">Similarly, we learned that customers feel that they've already developed analog habits that are difficult to overcome. By <strong>integrating</strong> experiences and features across digital channels, we can encourage customers to adopt the mobile app so that we could provide further convenience that analog methods are known to lack.</p>
          <a href="./result3.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./result3.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="result 3 revised image">
          </a>
          <p class="">At Capital One, our key imperative is to help Canadians succeed with credit. By presenting moments where we can <strong>motivate</strong> positive credit behaviours, customers have a reason to turn to their mobile app to help them wherever they are in their credit-building journey.</p>
          <a href="./result4.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <img src="./result4.jpg" class="img-fluid case-img zoomer" alt="result 4 revised image">
          </a>
          <p class="">Last but not least, customers relied on call centers because they believed they would obtain more guidance than if they self-served. By integrating features that help <strong>guide</strong> customers in an intelligent way, we could foster a relationship where the mobile app is a companion to their holistic experience.</p>

          <p class="case-subsection-title">Results</p>
          <p class="">Over the next year, the mobile team began to develop the recommended features that were shown to demonstrate significant interest in our Feature Prioritization survey. I continued to play a pivotal role in the research and strategy of these features, including a revamped Mobile Onboarding experience and the design and launch of our <a href="../messagecentre.html">Mobile Message Centre</a>.</p>

          <p class="">A year after socializing our research and analysis, the mobile team began to implement our strategic recommendations. We were able to increase mobile adoption by 7%, increase active users by 7%, and increase NPS by 8 points. Although these results are moderate, we can expect these KPIs to steadily increase as more of our recommendations continue to be developed and launched.</p>

        <div class="thinline"></div>
        <p>After this project, the mobile team continues to refine the app based on the empathy we developed, and build our recommended features to offer an optimal experience. However, this is not an isolated effort within the mobile team; our mobile vision continues to be a focus across the organization. Teams across the company integrate digital personas in their work in an effort to increase digital engagement as well. As a result of this project, I learned three key things:</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Long-term Investment, Long-term Gains</p>
        <p class="">While we weren't able to demonstrate ground-breaking changes in our KPIs by the end of the project, large strategic recommendations take time to build. Artifacts will remain valuable as tech teams continue to build upon our mobile vision.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Cross-Collaboration is Key</p>
        <p class="">Mobile Vision was a large strategic effort that required many moving parts and a solid understanding of the constraints and limitations that different teams experience. This is where initial stakeholder interviews played a pivotal role.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="case-subsection-title">Mixed-Methods give a Comprehensive View</p>
        <p class="">By combining different qualitative, quantative, and analytical methods, we were able to gain a well-rounded perspective of who our customers are. This view allows us to more effectively develop strategies that target their underlying needs.</p>
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        <p class="">Moving forward with this solution, we would like to analyse the platform longitudinally to verify that it saves time for our users compared to the traditional process. Additionally, we want to continue exploring deeper areas of brand customization to support buy-in from enterprise-level users and professionals who manage small teams on the platform.</p>
